## Introduction

Managers can create a catalog of items with image, description and price, as well as which products are available in which days, and at which quantities, while clients can place orders that can be approved and marked as delivered by the managers.

The app has a classic backend frontend separation, where a single mobile app is used for both managers and clients as the frontend, and a specialized api is deployed in a server to handle all the data.
